"""LLM evaluation prompt — Story 3.9 / FR13 / FR14 / FR15 / FR17.

The single source of truth for how the LLM is asked the matching
question. Every concrete :class:`ListingEvaluator` (Gemini Flash,
GPT-4o-mini, Claude Haiku) uses :func:`build_evaluation_prompt` so the
wording, the output schema, and the (c3) scope constraint are
identical across providers.

FR17 structural enforcement
---------------------------
The prompt asks ONE question — "does this listing match this wishlist
entry?". It does NOT ask for resale value, margin, market price,
arbitrage signal, or "good deal" framing. The
:data:`FORBIDDEN_PROMPT_TERMS` constant declares what cannot appear in
the prompt body; a unit test parametrizes over those terms and asserts
their absence on representative payloads. Adding any of them is a PRD
amendment.

# Words that, if present in the prompt body, would invite the LLM to
# produce arbitrage-flavored output. The unit test asserts none of them
# appear in any rendered prompt; if a future prompt-improvement PR
# accidentally introduces one, CI fails loud.
#: Cache invalidation sentinel — bump this every time the prompt body
#: changes meaningfully. The LLM evaluation cache (Story 3.10) keys
#: stored evaluations by ``(listing_url, prompt_version)`` so a bump
#: causes cache misses on every entry the next time we evaluate,
#: forcing a fresh LLM call with the new prompt. The constant lives
#: here (next to the prompt body) so a PR that changes the prompt and
#: forgets to bump this is caught in code review.
