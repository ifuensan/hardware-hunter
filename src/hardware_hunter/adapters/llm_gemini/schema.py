"""Pydantic shape for the Gemini Flash response — Story 3.9.

The model is instructed to reply with strict JSON matching this schema.
A non-conforming response surfaces as ``ValidationError`` and gets
wrapped in :class:`LlmEvaluationError` by the evaluator.

There are NO arbitrage-flavored fields here. The schema's surface area
is the structural enforcement of FR17 at the evaluator boundary —
even if the model went off-script and included a "margin" field, this
schema would silently drop it via ``extra="ignore"`` (we don't need
those values), and downstream code can't read them.
