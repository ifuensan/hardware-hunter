"""Wallapop Pay buy flow — Story 5.3 (FR25 / FR30).

Drives Wallapop's in-app **Wallapop Pay** checkout through TinyFish.
Wallapop Pay is the *only* rail this flow ever touches; Story 5.14's
payment-rail lint enforces that structurally by walking every file in
this package.

The flow operates the marketplace's existing UI — the operator's
already-authenticated session navigates to the listing URL, asserts the
expected elements are present, clicks the Wallapop-Pay buy button,
awaits the confirmation page, captures a screenshot and the receipt
ID, and returns a typed :class:`BuyResult`. Every uncertainty
(missing button, missing confirmation, missing screenshot) maps to a
``BuyFailure`` — never a silent success.
