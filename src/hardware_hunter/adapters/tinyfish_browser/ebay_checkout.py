"""eBay.es checkout buy flow — Story 5.3 (FR25 / FR30).

Drives eBay.es' official checkout through TinyFish. The flow uses
eBay's *checkout* page exclusively — Story 5.14's payment-rail lint
guarantees structurally that no off-platform rail ever lands in this
package, and the goal text below names the checkout URL pattern
explicitly so a goal-template drift is auditable.

The buy contract mirrors :mod:`wallapop_pay`: 9 explicit steps, every
uncertainty turns into a :class:`BuyFailure`, never a silent success.
